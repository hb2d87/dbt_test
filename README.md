Hereâ€™s a project overview focused on the semantic layer for the hb2d87/dbt_test repository:

This project is a dbt-based analytics platform, with a strong emphasis on a robust semantic layer for the Brazilian E-commerce Analytics Platform. The semantic layer acts as a business-friendly interface to your data, ensuring metric definitions remain consistent across teams, tools, and dashboards.

The semantic layer is organized in the models/semantic_models directory, which includes:
- Core semantic model definitions (base_semantic_model.yml)
- Metric group governance (metric_groups.yml)
- Business domain metrics (user_activity_metrics.yml, financial_metrics.yml, operational_metrics.yml)

Key aspects of the semantic layer:
- Provides clear business context for each metric, such as its purpose, impact, use cases, target ranges, and operational requirements.
- Enforces data governance standards on quality, access, change management, and compliance.
- Implements comprehensive RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) ownership for all metrics.
- Organizes metrics into logical groups (e.g., Executive Dashboard, User Engagement, Financial Performance, Operational Efficiency).
- Enables consistent dimensional analysis (geographic, time series) and includes SQL patterns for state/city and time-based breakdowns.
- Supports business and technical users with guidelines for metric selection, documentation, and quality assurance.
- Maintains a structured support and escalation process for metric and semantic layer issues.

Overall, the semantic layer in this dbt project is designed to make analytics scalable, trustworthy, and business-aligned, supporting self-service analytics while maintaining rigorous governance and data quality.
