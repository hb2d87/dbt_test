To properly experiment with dbt Semantic Layer (e.g. play and learn) I have: 
1. Used Brazilian E-commerce dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
2. Extracted it to AWS PosrtgreSQL
-   2.1. Wasted a lot of time to connect my local homelab PostgreSQL to dbt Cloud
3. Created free tier account in dbt Cloud
-  3.1. Wasted one demo account for dbt Cloud. Seems like you need paid tier to create and use Semantic Layer
4. Build all stage, intermediate and mart models (Claude is working good at this point. Just need to insert minor fixes)
5. Build Semantic Layer
-  5.1. Claude doesn't work properly at this stage
-  5.2. But educational courses are simple and great
-  5.3. Watch some YouTube video and understand the concept (basically it should replace Analytical Master Data later on)
-  5.4. Make it work -- we are here --
-  5.5. Connect to Google Sheet and Gemini LLM for Text-to-SQL
Conclusion:
It's really great concept that potentially should cover a big chunk of DQ&G work, ensure the Source of Truth, expedite analytics onboarding and work, reduce mistakes and potentially provide great self service tool for end clients (when we will solve informational security and data access policy). I have conversation with Serhan and he was really enthusiastic and told that he will provide support to push it further if needed.

### Hereâ€™s a project overview focused on the semantic layer for the hb2d87/dbt_test repository:

This project is a dbt-based analytics platform, with a strong emphasis on a robust semantic layer for the Brazilian E-commerce Analytics Platform. The semantic layer acts as a business-friendly interface to your data, ensuring metric definitions remain consistent across teams, tools, and dashboards.

The semantic layer is organized in the models/semantic_models directory, which includes:
- Core semantic model definitions (base_semantic_model.yml)
- Metric group governance (metric_groups.yml)
- Business domain metrics (user_activity_metrics.yml, financial_metrics.yml, operational_metrics.yml)

Key aspects of the semantic layer:
- Provides clear business context for each metric, such as its purpose, impact, use cases, target ranges, and operational requirements.
- Enforces data governance standards on quality, access, change management, and compliance.
- Implements comprehensive RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) ownership for all metrics.
- Organizes metrics into logical groups (e.g., Executive Dashboard, User Engagement, Financial Performance, Operational Efficiency).
- Enables consistent dimensional analysis (geographic, time series) and includes SQL patterns for state/city and time-based breakdowns.
- Supports business and technical users with guidelines for metric selection, documentation, and quality assurance.
- Maintains a structured support and escalation process for metric and semantic layer issues.

Overall, the semantic layer in this dbt project is designed to make analytics scalable, trustworthy, and business-aligned, supporting self-service analytics while maintaining rigorous governance and data quality.
